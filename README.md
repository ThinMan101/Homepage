# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Install Dependencies:
- `npm install` or `yarn`: Installs all dependencies needed for the project (React, Babel, TypeScript etc.).

- Run the app:
    - `npm run dev`: Starts the application in development mode with hot module replacement enabled. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173/]


- Development Server:
- Starts the development server using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which is a build tool that offers dev server out
  - Starts a development server that serves your code over HTTP/2 at localhost:3000.
  - The page will automatically refresh when you make changes to your files.
  - You can also open the app in multiple browsers using the extension [vite](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-vite).
